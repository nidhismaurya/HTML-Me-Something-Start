       <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">I have been living in the US from last 16 years. Since, I was born and raised in India, I love celebrating a lot of Indian festivals which are an integral part of our culture. India is a vast country with people from various religions and cultures , just like the USA. We have a lot of festivals though out the year but here I am just going to give glimpse of some of the major ones that we celebrating.</p>

   <p>This festival is observed throughout north India. It marks the end of winter and the dawn of the spring. The festival technically falls on the day following the full moon in March each year, but the celebrations begin in the night before. The day of Holi we celebrate by putting colored water and colored powders on each others. My kids love this festival.</p>

      <P>It is a festival representing the start of the Hindu New Year, it also honors the moral victories of good over evil. In India , it is the biggest and the most important holiday of the year. The festival gets its name from row of clay lamps(Deepa) that the Indians light outside their homes to symbolize the inner light that protects from the spiritual darkness. Here in the US , we celebrate by decorating inside and outside of our houses with lights and making some savoury sweets and traditional dishes. In the evening we wear traditional dresses, perform some rituals and the light some sparklers outside our homes.</P>
